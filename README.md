# task_NW

The project was conducted as part of research experiments: data loading, preliminary strategy evaluation, spread analysis between exchanges, and full backtesting. The final strategy logic is contained in the last module.

There are four files in this repository:

- `_01_load_data.ipynb` - loads the data and saves it as NumPy arrays.  
- `_02_strategies.ipynb` - analyzes basic simple strategies.  
- `_03_EDA.ipynb` - explores the spread between two exchanges.  
- `_04_backtest.ipynb` - performs a proper backtest in a loop.

To understand the final strategy, it's enough to study the **last file**.
